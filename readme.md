# Growing Neural Network

## Description
* Neural Network represented as directed graph with ability to grow new neurons

## Features
* New neurons and connection can be formed while learning
* Dead neurons are removed (ReLU's zero gradient)
* No need to specify number of layers/neurons when creating the network

## To-Do
* Implement Adam optimizer
* Automaticly add new neurons and connections
* Automaticly remove dead neurons
