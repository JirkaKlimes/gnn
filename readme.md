# Growing Neural Network

## Description
* Neural Network represented as directed graph with ability to grow new neurons

## Features
* New neurons and connection can be formed while learning
* Dead neurons are removed (ReLU's zero gradient)
* No need to specify number of layers/neurons when creating the network

## To-Do
* Implement Adam optimizer
* Automatically remove dead neurons
* Method for eporting gnn
* Create Rust library for fast computation on trained model
