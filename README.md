# Growing Neural Network

## Description

-   Neural Network represented as directed graph with ability to grow new neurons

## Features

-   New neurons and connection can be formed while learning
-   Dead neurons are removed (ReLU's zero gradient)
-   No need to specify number of layers/neurons when creating the network

## To-Do

-   Push/Backprop on cpu
-   Push/Backprop on cuda
-   BPTT
-   Implement gradient optimizers
-   Automatically remove dead neurons
